I love STORIES. I love an experience that can connect with an individual at a personal and meaningful level.

Currently I'm pursuing a passion for stories in the form of game development and language learning. I am focusing on these topics for 2 reasons:

1. I believe video games are a FANTASTIC way to experience a story. The immersive nature of a game can add extra depth to an experience that the written and spoken word alone just can't provide.

2. While not all stories require words - a great many do. And those words, with their meanings, matter a LOT. Both the meaning of those words to the storyteller, and (even more importantly) the interpretation of those words to those experiencing the story. Creating an experience that can be meaningful for everyone requires an understanding of words from the perspective of others - not just my own. So - I am focusing on language learning (the process of learning new words and their meanings).
